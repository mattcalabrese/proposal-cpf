# Customization Point Functions

Abstract: This paper proposes a new language facility for easily specifying,
overriding, and invoking single-function customization points that are
frequently used in generic libraries, such as `swap` of the standard library,
and `AbslHashValue` of Abseil. This proposal is intended to target a standard
after C++20.
